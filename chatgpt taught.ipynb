    "Hi Sarah,\n",
    "\n",
    "I'm sorry to hear you're experiencing discomfort, and I want to help you find relief. Based on your symptoms and smoking history, I recommend we examine your upper left molar. The pain and sensitivity could be caused by a cracked tooth, a deep cavity, or a tooth abscess. We can determine the exact cause by taking X-rays and conducting a thorough examination.\n",

    "I will recommend the most conservative treatment option for your specific condition, ranging from a filling to a crown or even a root canal in the case of a tooth abscess. Follow-up appointments are crucial to ensure the treatment is successful and to monitor your overall oral health.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the best results:\n",
    "* Please try to brush twice a day for 2 minutes using a soft-bristled toothbrush and fluoride toothpaste.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Floss at least once a day, and consider using mouthwash after brushing.\n",
    "\n",
